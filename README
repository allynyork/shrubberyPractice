included please find, this README (woo hoo!), shrubbery.rb (which is my program), and european_swallow.yaml (which i'm using for data driven testing)

WebDriver is required for any browser (e.g. Chrome) other than Firefox
currently chrome is commented out, adjust as suits you

from the command line % ruby shrubbery.rb 

the program will execute. a browser is opened. start and end points and travel mode are loaded from the yaml file. 
directions are displayed in browswer (as expected) and to the command line, because why not, it's easy. 
directions and screenshot are saved to the same folder as the program and yaml file 
using TextEdit (or similar) open directions_data.csv and there you go, the directions which can now be compared to what is generated by this mythical acquired company

thank you for your time
